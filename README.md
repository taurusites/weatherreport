# Weather Collation and Report APP

* Main control app - Satish
* Input required form 5 cities - Meghana
* Query API - Anita
* Take the data provided by api and format - Satish 
* Output to file - Girivardhan


## Key takeaways From todays session

* How to think about breaking up your requirements into specific tasks
* How to think about task distribution
* How to think about the modularity of your code
* Perhaps the most important thing I missed in the session itself was how to determine your data structures before you begin to program. Remember all weather services do not give the same shape/format of data, Hence there is a dataprocessing module in this project which will take all the different shapes in which the respective api provides data and you can then transform it into a shape/format that you can use.
